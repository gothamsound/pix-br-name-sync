PIX/Boom Recorder Name Sync
v1.0



This script synchronizes track names from Boom Recorder to a networked PIX recorder. Editing a track name in Boom Recorder should be reflected in real time on the PIX as long as the PIX is stopped.

Be sure to edit the .plist file to your unit's IP address and the number of tracks you want to synchronize from Boom Recorder.
